        Authentication

</div>
<div class='contents'>
    Authentication to use the LAN application is handled with HTTP Basic Authentication. User's logging in are searched by their unique username
    and the provided password is hashed and matched with the registered password for that account. Upon successful authentication, a token is then sent
    to the user and is passed along with each subsequent request. The token contains a secret key generated and verified by the server.
     The token will remain valid until a user logs out or after 12 hours which is the token expiration.

<div class='contents'>
    Want to implement LAN's REST API into your own app? Doing so is easy, once you have registered for
    a LAN account, you can click the "Developer?" link located at the footer of LAN's website. This will allow you to recieve
    JSON formatted data of your messages and newsfeed. After your username and password have been 
    verified, an API Key will be generarated for you. You will need to provide the key at the end of each of your requests to the LAN API.
    Here is an example request to retrieve all of items from your newsfeed with an API Key appended to the end: http://lan/api/v1/newsfeed/API=ETYN4667CVCDF

<div class='contents'>
    When accessing our API, you may occasionaly run into errors. Our API will do its best to inform you of the nature of the problem so you may act accordingly.
    The problems can range from problems on our server or something simple like a syntax error in your API request. All errors will be returned in JSON formatting 
    with an appropriate error code and a short description of the nature of the problem. For a full listing of the error codes and their descriptions you can expect to
    encounter please see them <a href='#/errors' >here.</a>
