    Authentication to use the LAN application is handled with HTTP Basic Authentication. User's logging in are searched
    by their unique username
    and the provided password is hashed and matched with the registered password for that account. Upon successful
    authentication, a token is then sent
    to the user and is passed along with each subsequent request. The token contains a secret key generated and verified
    by the server.
    The token will remain valid until a user logs out or after 12 hours which is the token expiration.

    Want to implement LAN's REST API into your own app? Doing so is easy, once you have registered for
    a LAN account, you can click the "Developer?" link located at the footer of LAN's website. This will allow you to
    recieve
    JSON formatted data of your messages and newsfeed. After your username and password have been
    verified, an API Key will be generarated for you. You will need to provide the key at the end of each of your
    requests to the LAN API.
    Here is an example request to retrieve all of items from your newsfeed with an API Key appended to the end:
    http://lan/api/v1/newsfeed/API=ETYN4667CVCDF
