    Making requests to our API is quite simple, using our base URL https://www.lan-social.com/api/ and appending the resource
    you wish to request. Currently our API only supports GET requests for Users, Messages, and Posts tied to your account's API key.
    You will not be able to POST, DELETE, UPDATE, etc... Click <a href='#/api'>here</a> for examples of accessing the Users resource.

    Authentication to use the LAN application is handled with HTTP Basic Authentication. User's logging in are searched
    by their unique username
    and the provided password is hashed and matched with the registered password for that account. Upon successful
    authentication, a token is then sent
    to the user and is passed along with each subsequent request. The token contains a secret key generated and verified
    by the server.
    The token will remain valid until a user logs out or after 12 hours which is the token expiration.

    Want to implement LAN's REST API into your own app? Doing so is easy, once you have registered for
    a LAN account, you can click the "Developer?" link located at the footer of LAN's website. This will allow you to
    recieve
    JSON formatted data of your messages and newsfeed. After your username and password have been
    verified, an API Key will be generarated for you. You will need to provide the key at the end of each of your
    requests to the LAN API.
    Here is an example request to retrieve all of items from your newsfeed with an API Key appended to the end:
    http://lan/api/v1/newsfeed/API=ETYN4667CVCDF

    When accessing our API, you may occasionaly run into errors. Our API will do its best to inform you of the nature of the problem so you may act accordingly.
    The problems can range from problems on our server or something simple like a syntax error in your API request. All errors will be returned in JSON formatting 
    with an appropriate error code and a short description of the nature of the problem. For a full listing of the error codes and their descriptions you can expect to
    encounter please see them <a href='#/errors' >here.</a>

    <i>(Click image to enlarge.)</i> The use case for this project is for gamers to connect with other gamers. They begin by creating an account through the registration screen, which requires email, password, and ZIP code, and then logging in after they are successfully registered. The user will then be prompted to define their favorite games and favorite game genres. This will complete their profile and make it easier to match with other users based on this information. Now, the user can find local gamers by their location and see who they have common games with. They can also message other users and add them as friends. Adding a user as a friend allows for their game updates to display in the users news feed. Another option for the user is to update their game status. They will be able to select what game they are currently playing, write commentary about it, and post it to the common news feed. This update will only be viewable by people on their friends list.
